We're not done yet. We decided to interview Prachi Durge, who has abundance of experience of working in tech and other STEM fields.

## The Story of Prachi Durge

An Ambassador of Women TechMakers in Vadodara, Prachi is an inspirational woman working in tech with loads of experience under her belt.With a Math degree, she has explored different fields in STEM like Business Analysis, Process Executive, and she's currently working as an Android Developer with AVDEVS Solutions.

Talking about her experience, she highlighted her struggles in her initial days when she didn't have enough support from her seniors and she wasn't received very well when she herself was pursuing senior and leadership roles. She highlighted the importance of giving equal opportunities to everyone and creating a fair and growth-friendly environment.

As of today, Prachi leads workshops or mentor programs for women who are starting out in tech and she works with organizations to create more inclusive and supportive environments for women in workplaces. She truly is an inspiration.
